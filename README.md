# Minimal React project

## Installation

* Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (this also installs the npm package manager).
* Install the npm packages that this repository depends on:
  ```
  cd minimal-react
  npm install
  ```

## Running the project

* Start the development server:
  ```
  cd minimal-react
  npm start
  ```
* The dev server prints root URLs to the console, e.g.: [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/)
  * Open one of them in a web browser.
* The browser tab is refreshed automatically when you change either HTML or JavaScript code.

## Building the project

You can also create a stand-alone version of this web app that doesnâ€™t need the development server to run:

```js
npm run build
```

Afterwards, the complete web app is in directory `minimal-react/build`, ready to be deployed.
